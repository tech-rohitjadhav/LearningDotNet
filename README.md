## SOLID Principles Demonstrated

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**"A class should have only one reason to change"**

**Example**: User Management System
- `UserService`: Handles user business logic
- `UserRepository`: Handles data persistence
- `EmailService`: Handles email operations
- `User`: Represents user data

Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**"Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification"**

**Example**: Shape Area Calculator
- `IShape`: Base interface for all shapes
- `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`: Concrete shape implementations
- `AreaCalculator`: Works with any shape implementing `IShape`

New shapes can be added without modifying existing code.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass"**

**Example**: Bird Zoo System
- `IBird`: Base interface for all birds
- `IFlyableBird`, `ISwimmableBird`: Specific behavior interfaces
- `Eagle`, `Penguin`, `Duck`: Different bird implementations

All bird types can be substituted without breaking functionality.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use"**

**Example**: Workplace Management System
- `IWorker`: Basic work functionality
- `IEater`, `ISleeper`: Separate behavior interfaces
- `IManager`: Management-specific interface
- `HumanWorker`, `RobotWorker`, `Manager`: Different worker types

Each worker type implements only the interfaces it needs.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**"Depend on abstractions, not concretions"**

**Example**: Order Management System
- `IOrderRepository`: Data access abstraction
- `INotificationService`: Notification abstraction
- `ILogger`: Logging abstraction
- `OrderService`: High-level module depending on abstractions

Dependencies are injected, making the system flexible and testable.

## Design Patterns Demonstrated

### 🏗️ Creational Patterns (5)

#### 1. Singleton Pattern
**Purpose**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it.
**Example**: Database connection, Logger
**Key Features**: Thread-safe implementation, Lazy<T> approach, Global access point

#### 2. Factory Method Pattern
**Purpose**: Creates objects without specifying their exact classes.
**Example**: Vehicle manufacturing system
**Key Features**: Abstract creator, Template method, Extensible for new types

#### 3. Abstract Factory Pattern
**Purpose**: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
**Example**: Furniture manufacturing (Modern vs Victorian)
**Key Features**: Factory for each product family, Consistent families, Easy style addition

**Purpose**: Constructs complex objects step by step.
**Example**: Computer building system
**Key Features**: Fluent interface, Director for configurations, Flexible construction

#### 5. Prototype Pattern
**Purpose**: Creates objects by cloning existing instances.
**Example**: Employee management system
**Key Features**: Deep cloning, Registry management, Efficient object creation

### 🏗️ Structural Patterns (7)

#### 6. Adapter Pattern
**Purpose**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
**Example**: Legacy printer adapter

**Example**: Coffee customization system
**Key Features**: Runtime modification, Flexible enhancement, Composition over inheritance

#### 10. Facade Pattern
**Purpose**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
**Example**: Computer startup/shutdown system
**Key Features**: Simplified interface, Complex hiding, Single entry point

#### 11. Flyweight Pattern
**Purpose**: Minimizes memory usage by sharing intrinsic state.
**Example**: Tree rendering system
**Key Features**: Shared intrinsic state, Extrinsic separation, Memory optimization

**Example**: Image loading proxy
**Key Features**: Lazy loading, Access control, Caching capabilities

### 🎭 Behavioral Patterns (11)

#### 13. Observer Pattern
**Purpose**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.
**Example**: News agency and subscribers
**Key Features**: Loose coupling, Dynamic subscription, Event-driven architecture

#### 14. Strategy Pattern
**Purpose**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
**Example**: Payment processing system
**Key Features**: Runtime selection, Algorithm encapsulation, Easy addition

#### 15. Command Pattern
**Purpose**: Encapsulates a request as an object.
**Example**: Remote control system
**Key Features**: Request encapsulation, Undo/redo, Queue and logging support

#### 16. State Pattern
**Purpose**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
**Example**: Vending machine system
**Key Features**: State-specific behavior, Clean transitions, Eliminates conditionals

#### 17. Template Method Pattern
**Purpose**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method.
**Example**: Data processing pipeline
**Key Features**: Algorithm structure, Step customization, Code reuse

#### 18. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
**Purpose**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
**Example**: Approval system
**Key Features**: Request handling chain, Dynamic addition, Decoupled sender/receiver

#### 19. Mediator Pattern
**Purpose**: Defines how objects interact with each other.
**Example**: Chat system
**Key Features**: Centralized communication, Reduced coupling, Simplified interaction

#### 20. Memento Pattern
**Purpose**: Captures and restores an object's internal state.
**Example**: Text editor with undo functionality
**Key Features**: State preservation, Undo/redo, History management

#### 21. Visitor Pattern
**Purpose**: Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on.
**Example**: Shopping cart with different calculations
**Key Features**: Algorithm separation, Easy addition, Double dispatch

#### 22. Iterator Pattern
**Purpose**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.
**Example**: Music playlist system
**Key Features**: Collection traversal, Uniform interface, Multiple algorithms

#### 23. Interpreter Pattern
**Purpose**: Defines a grammar and provides an interpreter for it.
**Example**: Simple calculator
**Key Features**: Grammar definition, Expression evaluation, Language interpretation
